A simple x86 16-bit real mode program that can be installed
in the master boot record of any device and then boots up.
This program just uses main.asm as a driver and then calls
the functions in printaddr.asm to print out an address in hex. 

To compile:

nasm main.asm -f bin -o main

To run:
qemu main
