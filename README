to compile:
nasm main.asm -f bin -o main

to run:
./run_qemu main

The reason for the run_qemu bash script is that qemu now needs to specify format of raw
so that it won't give a warning. So we pass in the binary as a variable.

-----------

When we get to the point that we are going to load the C kernel we have to pad the os-image with extra space to make it big enough to read 15 sectors. If you don't do this then you will get disk read errors.

gcc -ffreestanding -c kernel.c -o kernel.o
ld -o kernel.bin -Ttext 0x1000 kernel.o --oformat binary
cat boot_sect.bin kernel.bin > os-image
dd if=/dev/zero bs=512 count=20 >> os-image
./run_qemu os-image
